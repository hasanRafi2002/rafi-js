////  what is functional programing?

----->   functional programing is a programing paradigm- a style of building the
        structure and element of computer programs- that threats computation as the
        evaluation of mathmatical functions and avoids changing- state and mutable data

        // three main terms

        1. pure function
        2. first class function
        3. higher order function

********** Function acts like a value ***********

 
////   Arguments

The arguments is an object which is local to a function. You can think of it as a local variable 
that is available with all functions by default except arrow functions in JavaScript. This object 
(arguments) is used to access the parameter passed to a function. It is only available within a function


*************Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.*************

*************  arguments is an array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.************
